### About me (Last Updated: 3/31/23)

I am an electrical engineer with a focus on machine learning and computer vision. I'm currently working towards finishing my bachelor's at UCLA, and I will be starting my master's shortly.

### Plans for the future

I'm currently learning new languages to become a full stack developer. I am planning on learning JS, HTML, and SQL. I'm working on a JS browser game as a beginning project. I am also working on a personal research project in transformer architecture in 2D vision transformers.
